      I primarily work in social computing studying online community behaviors and dynamics, particularly how we make these virtual spaces both inclusive and productive. Currently, I'm working on expanding our notions of community success to encompass a community's ability to overcome crisis: community resilience. I also collaborate with computer science education researchers by understanding how students learn Structured Query Language (SQL)â€”a paradigm shift from studying imperative programming languages usually taught. Through my scholarly work, I strive to make significant impacts in how we cultivate online spaces and educate the next generation of computer scientists.
